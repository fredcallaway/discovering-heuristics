# Paper README
The paper is written in pandoc-enhanced markdown, the premier docuent-preparation system.


## Dependencies.
You'll need the latest version of pandoc and the pandoc-fignos package.

```
    brew install pandoc
    pip install pandoc-fignos
```

## Compile
Use `make` to compile the pdf. The references won't work for you because you don't have my bibliography, but that's probabably okay for now.

## Citations
The @ symbol marks references. @griffiths99 will produce a citatation like Griffiths (1999), whereas [@griffiths99] will produce (Griffiths, 1999).

## Images
An image has the following syntax:
```
![My capricious caption](path/to/image.pdf){#fig:lousy_label}
```
It can be referenced in the text like so: See +@fig:lousy_label. The + tells the cleverref package to add "fig." before the figure number.

## Variables
In paper.md, you'll notice variables such as `CORRECT_WALL_SE`. These are replaced at compilation time based on variables.sed, a file generated by analysis.ipynb.
