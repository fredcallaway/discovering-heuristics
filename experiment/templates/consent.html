          This HIT is a psychology experiment being conducted by Fred Callaway and
          Jessica Hamrick, graduate students in Professor Tom Griffiths’s
          Computational Cognitive Science Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.
          In order to consent to participate, you MUST meet the following criteria:
          <ul>
          <li>18 years of age or older.</li>
          <li>Fluent speaker of English.</li>
          <li>Have not participated in this experiment before.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
          This study is designed to investigate how people can make judgments about how
          physical objects and/or agents interact with each other. You will be asked to
          perform tasks that involve seeing objects and performing memory and/or problem
          solving tasks.
          </p>

          <p>
          The study will take about 14 minutes, and will pay $1.50.
          </p>

          <p>
          Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may refrain from answering
          any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at
          any time without penalty by returning the HIT on MTurk and emailing the
          experimenter at the address provided below.
          </p>

          <p>
          Participating will provide no direct benefits to you. But, we hope that this
          research will benefit society at large. Many problems that people can solve very
          easily are very difficult to automate (to have computers solve). By revealing
          more about how humans learn and think, our research may help others to build and
          program computers that can solve these kinds of problems.
          </p>

          <p>
          Your MTurk worker ID may be connected to individual responses, and you may be
          asked to provide an email address, but this will be optional (you can complete
          the whole study without providing an email should you choose). We will handle
          responses as confidentially as possible. We cannot however guarantee the
          confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. We will be keeping
          data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely. Data without any
          personally identifiable data associated with it will be made available on public
          research data sharing sites for further analysis.
          </p>
