The ad.html has a very specific format.

Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
your hit.

The second part of the ad display after the person selected
"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

See comments throughout for hints

       <h1>Call for participants</h1>
       <p>The Computational Cognitive Science Group at the University
           of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) is looking for online
           participants for a brief experiment on how people reason about
           physics.</p>

           <p id="screen-size" class="alert alert-danger"></p>

           <p>In this experiment, you will watch a ball bouncing around in a
              box. Your task is to try to predict whether the ball will go
              through a hole in the wall.The experiment typically takes about
              <b>14 minutes</b> to complete.</p>

<!--            <p>The base pay is $0.40. Depending on your performance, you can receive
              a bonus of up to $0.50 for a <b>maximum total pay of $0.90</b>.
              Based on pilot studies, we estimate the average bonus to be $0.37 for
              an <b>average total pay of $0.77</b>. -->
           </p>

              <p>The requirements are:</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Your screen has dimensions of at least 920 x 760 pixels,</li>
                  <li>You are at least 18 years old,</li>
                  <li>You have normal vision or wear corrective lenses, and</li>
                  <li>You are a fluent English speaker.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Note: the experiment will only work in recent browsers, and
               may have difficulty loading on slower connections.</p>

                 <strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong>

                 HIT so someone else can participate.
